    <h1>What worked well for you over the last 9 weeks that aided in your learning process?</h1>
    <p>Have the structure we had definitely helped me a lot in my learning process. Having lecture, followed by a demo, then doing a lecture activity really solidified the new information for me</p>
    <br>
    <h1>What would you change about the course?</h1>
    <p>I think the only thing I would change would be the IT issues we had throughout the semester.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course? </h1>
    <p>I definitely learned everything I wanted to learn and more, I'm really happy with the course.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>What concepts were new to you and what concepts had you already encountered in the past?</h1>
    <p>Pretty much all concepts were new for me. I had never done HTML before, the closest I got was hearing what my boyfriend would tell me.</p>
